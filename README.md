# Intellux
Household blinds currently require manual operation to allow a desired amount of natural light through to illuminate one’s living space. With varying weather and brightness throughout the day, it can become quite tedious to constantly shut or open the blinds for the desired effect within one’s room. Intellux aims to automate this process by sensing the light within and outside the room and adjusting the blinds to bring in the desired amount of natural light. To further reduce the cost and inconvenience to the user, Intellux will be an external accessory to be installed into blinds with beaded chords, which is a wide variety of existing blinds. Thus, making it a more convenient living experience for users. Users usually close manually operable blinds to reduce visual discomfort or excessive sunlight. Most of the time the blinds remain in this state for the rest of the day, even when the weather and sunlight levels return to an acceptable level. This leads to the user switching on artificial lights during the day which leads to inefficient electrical energy consumption. Intellux can help achieve energy efficiency through strategies to reduce artificial lighting by intelligent daylight utilization
